# PoseDesigner

*PoseDesigner* is an application designed to make pose generation and
recognition easy for developers working with the Xbox Kinect. While the
next milestone release will aim to robustly support only static poses,
the framework is designed to be easily extended to include dynamic gestures
or short movement clips.
